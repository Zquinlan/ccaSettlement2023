## Repository Contents
### /Code
#### 2019
- *ccaSettlement2019.R* This code analyzes the settlement response of *Acropora palmata*, *Orbicella faveolata*, and *Diploria laborynthiformis* from the tissue-associated and exometabolites of *Hydrolithon boergesenii* and *Paragoniolithon solubile*.

#### 2023
- *mainAnalysis.R* This code analyzes the settlement response of *Colpophylia natans* in response to exometabolite extracts from *Hydrolithon boergesenii* in our 2023 experiments.
- *metabAnalysis.R* This code takes the raw metabolomics data from our 2023 experiment.
